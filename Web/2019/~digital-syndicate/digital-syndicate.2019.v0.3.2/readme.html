5a. Hyperlinking is not copyright infringement, EU court rules<br>
</b><br>
Does publishing a hyperlink to freely available content amount<br>to an illegal 
communication to the
public and therefore a breach<br>of creator's copyrights under European law? After 
examining a case<br>
referred to it by Sweden's Court of Appeal, the Court of Justice<br>of the European 
Union has ruled
today that no, it does not.<br>
<br>
The European Union has been expanding since its creation in the<br>1950s and is now 
comprised of 28
member states, each committed<br>to EU law.<br>
<br>
One of the key roles of the EU's Court of Justice is to examine<br>and interpret EU 
legislation to
ensure its uniform application<br>across all of those member states. The Court is 
also called upon<br>
by national courts to clarify finer points of EU law to progress<br>local cases 
with Europe-wide
implications.<br>
<br>
One such case, referred to the CJEU by Sweden's Court of Appeal,<br>is of 
particular interest to
Internet users as it concerns the<br>very mechanism that holds the web together.<br>
<br>
The dispute centers on a company called Retriever Sverige AB,<br>an Internet-based 
subscription
service that indexes links to<br>articles that can be found elsewhere online for 
free.<br>
<br>
The problem came when Retriever published links to articles<br>published on a 
newspaper's website
that were written by Swedish<br>journalists. The company felt that it did not have 
to compensate<br>
the journalists for simply linking to their articles, nor did it<br>believe that 
embedding them
within its site amounted to copyright<br>infringement.<br>
<br>
The journalists, on the other hand, felt that by linking to their<br>articles 
Retriever
had &quot;communicated&quot; their works to the public<br>without permission. In the belief 
they should be
paid, the<br>journalists took their case to the Stockholm District Court.<br>They lost 
their case in
2010 and decided to take the case to appeal.<br>From there the Svea Court of Appeal 
sought advice
from the EU Court.<br>
<br>
Today the Court of Justice published its lengthy decision and it's<br>largely good 
news
for the Internet.<br>
<br>
&quot;In the circumstances of this case, it must be observed that making<br>available 
the works
concerned by means of a clickable link, such as<br>that in the main proceedings, 
does not lead to
the works in question<br>being communicated to a new public,&quot; the Court writes.<br>
<br>
&quot;The public targeted by the initial communication consisted of all<br>potential 
visitors to the
site concerned, since, given that access<br>to the works on that site was not 
subject to any
restrictive measures,<br>all Internet users could therefore have free access to 
them,&quot; it adds.<br>
<br>
&quot;Therefore, since there is no new public, the authorization of the<br>copyright 
holders is not
required for a communication to the public<br>such as that in the main proceedings.&quot;<br>
<br>
However, the ruling also makes it clear that while publishing a link<br>to freely 
available
content does not amount to infringement, there are<br>circumstances where
that would not be the case.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where a clickable link makes it possible for users of the site on which<br>that 
link appears to
circumvent restrictions put in place by the site on<br>which the protected work 
appears in order
to restrict public access to<br>that work to the latter site's subscribers only, 
and the link
accordingly<br>constitutes an intervention without which those users would not be 
able<br>to access
the works transmitted, all those users must be deemed to be a<br>new public,&quot; the 
Court writes.<br>
<br>
So, in basic layman's terms, if content is already freely available after<br>being 
legally published
and isn't already subject to restrictions such as<br>a subscription or pay wall, 
linking to or
embedding that content does not<br>communicate it to a new audience and
is therefore not a breach of EU law.<br>
<br>
The decision, which concurs with the opinions of a panel of scholars,<br>appears to 
be good news
for anyone who wants to embed a YouTube video<br>in their blog or Facebook page, 
but bad news
for certain collecting<br>societies who feel that embedding should result
in the payment of a<br>licensing fee.<b><br>
<br>
5b. Hyperlinking Isn't Illegal: The Bulk of Barrett Brown's Charges<br>Were Dropped<br>
</b><br>
Today federal prosecutors requested that the main charge in Barrett<br>Brown's 
case-which stemmed
from the pasting of a hyperlink containing<br>leaked credit card data from the 
Statfor hack-be
dismissed, along<br>with 10 other charges. The motion to dismiss filed by 
prosecutors<br>is a big
victory for Brown, who was facing more than a century in<br>prison, as well as 
advocates of
information freedom and journalists.<br>
<br>
The biggest concern all along has been that if Brown were convicted<br>of sharing a 
hyperlink,
it might well dissuade journalists and<br>bloggers (or anyone else, really) from 
undertaking
similar actions<br>in their work. With that now derailed, the case now stands as 
good<br>precedent
that sharing a link to freely available information as<br>part of a journalistic 
investigation
is not an illegal act.<br>
<br>
To briefly recap the case, Brown originally copied and pasted the<br>Stratfor 
hyperlink from
#AnonOps IRC (Internet Relay Chat) to<br>#ProjectPM IRC (a relay under Brown's 
control) as part
of ProjectPM,<br>the imprisoned journalist's effort to unmask the 
cyber-spy-industrial<br>complex.<br>
The leaked data included the email addresses of 860,000 Stratfor<br>subscribers, 
but also 60,000
credit card details. This data was<br>already available to the public when Brown 
pasted it to his<br>
IRC, though that didn't stop the Department of Justice, from<br>claiming Brown's 
actions were
illegal because of they made the<br>information more public.<br>
<br>
The wisdom of pasting a hyperlink of stolen credit card information<br>into an IRC 
is worth a
debate, but there is no indication that Brown<br>carried it out with any intent to 
defraud card
holders. Instead,<br>Brown's ProjectPM team routinely scoured troves of both leaked<br>and public
documents to illuminate the threads connecting US spy<br>bureaus, private 
intelligence firms
(like Stratfor), programs like<br>TrapWire, Silicon Valley data analytics firms 
like Palantir,<br>
as well as banks, venture capitalists and angel investors like<br>Peter Thiel,
and other intelligence contractors.<br>
<br>
In short, Brown occupied himself with some of the same work that<br>Edward Snowden 
would later
pursue with his massive NSA leaks.<br>
<br>
While prosecutors did not lay out their rationale in their motion<br>to dismiss 11 
of 12 charges
facing Brown, Brown's legal team<br>emphasized these ProjectPM objectives in its 
own 43-page motion.<br>
In it, Brown's lawyers argued that the government had failed to<br>allege an 
offense (based on legal
definitions of &quot;authentication<br>feature&quot; and &quot;transfer&quot;); penalized Brown for 
conduct protected<br>
under the First Amendment (pasting the hyperlink); and prosecuted<br>him under 
Section 1028 and
1028A of US code of law, which is<br>&quot;constitutionally vague and overbroad&quot; 
relative to Brown's<br>
hyperlinking. <br>
<br>
The last point is critical. As Brown's attorneys wrote in the<br>motion, &quot;A person 
of ordinary
intelligence would have no meaningful<br>notice as to whether it was a crime to 
knowingly possess or
transfer<br>an item that satisfies all the requirements of an authentication<br>feature but is not
issued by a government entity.&quot; (An<br>authentication feature is a hologram, symbol, 
code, etc.,
issued<br>by a government entity.) The credit cards at issue in the hyperlink<br>were 
issued by
private entities, not a government, making it<br>unlikely that the transfer of 
authentication
features charge would<br>have held up in court.<br>
<br>
Now that the hyperlink charge has been dismissed, journalists can<br>rest easier 
knowing that
cutting and pasting leaked documents won't<br>land them a lengthy prison term, and 
the case lends
weight to the<br>argument that hyperlinking is an act of free speech. Another point<br>worth
highlighting in Brown's motion to dismiss is that even if the<br>law were precise 
in its fair
warning language (as to the transfer<br>of authentication features),
to prosecute on this basis would still<br>suppress protected speech.<br>
<br>
The decision to drop the case also appears to settle (for now) the<br>question of 
whether or not
journalists like Brown-as noted in the<br>motion to dismiss-run afoul of the law in 
undertaking
press<br>activities such as &quot;newsgathering and research
(e.g. by downloading<br>content from a public website),
or verification of sources (e.g. by<br>reading that content).&quot; If this were 
illegal,
then journalists might<br>not be able to verify sources and determine fact from 
fiction,<br>
an integral part of the job.<br>
<br>
It's also worth noting a section in Brown's motion to dismiss that<br>deals with 
the chilling effect
that the hyperlink charges might<br>have had on cybersecurity research,
which also requires dealing<br>with hacked data:<br>
<br>
Private security researchers are often depended on by companies<br>like Stratfor to 
conduct
unsolicited forensic analysis of data<br>dumps in order to find out who conducted 
the hacks
and how future<br>attacks can be avoided. [See Nicole Perlroth, reporting from the<br>Web's
Underbelly, NY TIMES, Feb 16, 2014.] In doing so, these<br>security researchers
(many of whom analyzed the Stratfor hack)<br>knowingly transfer hacked data onto 
their systems.<br>
<br>
Still, the ruling doesn't negate the enormous legal ordeal Brown<br>has faced-he 
spent more
than a year in jail, not to mention legal<br>fees and a government gag order-which 
is a
chilling effect of its own.<br>
<br>
The government's case leaned heavily on charges relating to the<br>credit card data, 
and if there is
a larger lesson to be learned here,<br>it might be that individuals probably 
shouldn't post
hyperlinks<br>containing credit card information. Yet while credit card information<br>is pretty
universally understood to be sensitive information,<br>such a distinction
isn't always so clear.</p>
