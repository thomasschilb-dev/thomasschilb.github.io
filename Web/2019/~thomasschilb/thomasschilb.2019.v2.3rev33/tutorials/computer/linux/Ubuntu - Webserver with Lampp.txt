Ubuntu - Webserver with Lampp

How do I install LAMPP in Linux?


1.


a.

Choose your flavor for your linux OS, the 32-bit or 64-bit version.


b.

Change the permissions to the installer

chmod 755 xampp-linux-*-installer.run


c.

Run the installer

sudo ./xampp-linux-*-installer.run

That's all. XAMPP is now installed below the /opt/lampp directory.


2.

After I rebooted my Linux box XAMPP stopped running! How can I fix this?

Correct. That's normal Linux behaviour (which applies to any other Unix-like system).
It's the admin's job to make sure a particular application is started at bootup.

There is no real standard way to configure the boot process of a Linux system,
but most of them should allow you to start LAMPP at boot time using the following steps.

Debian, Ubuntu.

a.

sudo ln -s /opt/lampp/lampp /etc/init.d/lampp


b.

sudo update-rc.d lampp start 80 2 3 4 5 . stop 30 0 1 6 .


5.

How do I enable access to phpMyAdmin from the outside?

a.

In the basic configuration of XAMPP, phpMyAdmin is accessible only from the same host
that LAMPP is running on, at http://127.0.0.1 or http://localhost.

To enable remote access to phpMyAdmin, follow these steps:
Edit the etc/extra/httpd-xampp.conf file in your XAMPP installation directory.
Within this file, find the line below and update it to remove 'phpmyadmin' from the list of locations.

<LocationMatch "^/(?i:(?:xampp|security|licenses|phpmyadmin|webalizer|server-status|server-info))">

Restart the Apache server using the XAMPP control panel.
