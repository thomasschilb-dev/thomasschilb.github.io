Ubuntu - Window Manager


1. How to install and use Window Manager Control in Linux?

sudo apt-get install wmctrl


2. Show information about the window manager and about the environment?

wmctrl -m


3. Show which window manager you are running at your actual session?

ls /usr/bin/*session

-> in GNOME returns /usr/bin/gnome-session (and more)

-> in MATE returns /usr/bin/mate-session (and more)

-> in LXDE returns /usr/bin/lxsession (and more)

-> in JWM returns /usr/bin/icewm-session (should be jwm-session, not?!)

-> etc.
