FluxBB - This fixes deprecation warnings with PHP 7+ in FluxBB v1.5.10

PHP 7+ compatibility

This fixes deprecation warnings in PHP 7+, however it also means
we now require at least PHP 5.3 (about time, eh?).

* Before closures, PHP offered create_function(), which is now
  deprecated.
* Instead of the deprecated mcrypt extension, we can use the
  native random_bytes() function in PHP 7+.

Fixes #1109.
