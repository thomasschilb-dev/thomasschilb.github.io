Add Repositories in Debian (Fedora, OpenSuse, Mandriva)

Installing software in Linux is different from Windows in that it is done via repositories.
It can help to think of package managers as the equivalent of an advanced version of Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel in Windows. This way programs can be virus checked before the user installs them.

In Mandriva - urpmi.addmedia
