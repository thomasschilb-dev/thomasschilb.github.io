Add Debian-DVDs to install via APT


CD-ROM

If you'd rather use your CD-ROM for installing packages or updating your system automatically with APT, you can put it in your /etc/apt/sources.list. To do so, you can use the apt-cdrom program like this:

# apt-cdrom add

with the Debian CD-ROM in the drive.


You can use -d for the directory of the CD-ROM mount point or add a non-CD mount point (i.e. a USB keydrive).
