I found this closed thread (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=782897) from 2008: it had no answer, despite the desirability of a 7-Zip GUI. After trying various approaches, I found that the Windows version works well under Wine. In addition to providing a GUI version, it also handles file types that the Ubuntu command-line version does not recognise, such as virtual discs (*.vmdk).

I used the Portable Apps (http://portableapps.com/) version (many of the Portable Apps run under Wine, including the GUI). The only draw-back is that files need to be opened in the Wine environment, but I made this more or less transparent by

creating a short-cut ~/.local/share/applications/7-Zip.desktop using the Command line

Exec=wine c:\\\\PA\\\\PortableApps\\\\7-ZipPortable\\\\7-ZipPortable.exe Z:%f

(assuming that Z: addresses the root file system in Wine).

This allowed me to add the 7-Zip GUI to the Open With list for the files I want it to open.

As the final icing on the cake, I used Portable IcoFX (also under Wine) to extract an icon from the Windows executable to use in the launcher.

I am running Wine 1.6.2 under Ubuntu 15.04.
