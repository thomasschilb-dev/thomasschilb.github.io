Debian - Wine - Download Winetricks

That's a script that you need to download and then run, it's akin to a windows 'batch' script but far more powerful. Type the following into a terminal to download and run the script.


Code:

wget -O /tmp/winetricks http://winetricks.org/winetricks
chmod +x /tmp/winetricks
sudo /tmp/winetricks


Explanation:

1) wget downloads the file to the /tmp directory
2) chmod sets the file as being executable
3) runs the script as root


See the install guide for more information:
