Ubuntu - IRC-Chat with Irssi


1. How to install and setup Irssi in Linux?

sudo apt-get install irssi


2. Irssi - autoconnect, autoidentify, autojoinchannels

There are loads of irssi scripts which do this, but the truth is irssi
actually supports these things very well out of the box. Here’s how.

a. Start up irssi, then:

/connect irc.freenode.net
/nick MyIRCNick
/SERVER ADD -auto -ssl -network freenode irc.freenode.net 6667 <password>

(you may have to shutdown and restart irssi at this point for it
to recognize the network name “freenode” in the next step)

b. Another method of auto-identifying is seen below. The above is generally preferred.

/NETWORK ADD -autosendcmd "/^msg NickServ IDENTIFY password;wait 2000" freenode

c. To add channels:

/CHANNEL ADD -auto #ubuntu freenode
