Hi Thomas,<br /><br />I noticed you have a link to tcpdump - http://thomasschilb.tk/?to=tools and I wanted to suggest an additional resource to include on your page.<br /><br />My colleague Tim put together a cheat sheet for tcpdump - https://comparite.ch/tcpdumpcs<br /><br />The chances are that anyone using tcpdump would likely benefit from our cheat sheet which is a good, quick reference guide to the main features and commands.<br /><br />Please let me know your thoughts on adding this link to your page?<br /><br />Thank you in advance.<br /><br />-Hannah<br /><br />PS. I hope this suggestion is useful for you but please let me know if it isn’t and I won’t message you again. <br /><br /> <br />Hannah Bowen<br /><br />Comparitech - tech compared and reviewed<br /><br /><br /><br />Comparitech is owned and operated by Comparitech Limited, company no. 09962280, Kings Lodge, London Road, West Kingsdown, Sevenoaks, Kent, TN15 6AR United Kingdom.

Hello thomasschilb.tk,<br /><br />People ask, “why does TalkWithCustomer work so well?”<br /><br />It’s simple.<br /><br />TalkWithCustomer enables you to connect with a prospective customer at EXACTLY the Perfect Time.<br /><br />- NOT one week, two weeks, three weeks after they’ve checked out your website thomasschilb.tk.<br />- NOT with a form letter style email that looks like it was written by a bot.<br />- NOT with a robocall that could come at any time out of the blue.<br /><br />TalkWithCustomer connects you to that person within seconds of THEM asking to hear from YOU.<br /><br />They kick off the conversation.<br /><br />They take that first step.<br /><br />They ask to hear from you regarding what you have to offer and how it can make their life better. <br /><br />And it happens almost immediately. In real time. While they’re still looking over your website thomasschilb.tk, trying to make up their mind whether you are right for them.<br /><br />When you connect with them at that very moment it’s the ultimate in Perfect Timing – as one famous marketer put it, “you’re entering the conversation already going on in their mind.”<br /><br />You can’t find a better opportunity than that.<br /><br />And you can’t find an easier way to seize that chance than TalkWithCustomer. <br /><br />CLICK HERE http://www.talkwithcustomer.com now to take a free, 14-day test drive and see what a difference “Perfect Timing” can make to your business.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Eric<br /><br />PS:  If you’re wondering whether NOW is the perfect time to try TalkWithCustomer, ask yourself this:<br />“Will doing what I’m already doing now produce up to 100X more leads?”<br />Because those are the kinds of results we know TalkWithCustomer can deliver.  <br />It shouldn’t even be a question, especially since it will cost you ZERO to give it a try. <br />CLICK HERE http://www.talkwithcustomer.com to start your free 14-day test drive today.<br /><br />If you'd like to unsubscribe click here http://liveserveronline.com/talkwithcustomer.aspx?d=thomasschilb.tk<br />
