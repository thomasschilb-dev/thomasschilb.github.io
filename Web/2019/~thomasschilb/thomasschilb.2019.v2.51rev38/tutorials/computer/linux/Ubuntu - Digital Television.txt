Ubuntu - Digital Television


Anyone wishing to use a DVB T/S/C (ATSC in the United States) USB stick or a pre-installed TV card;
requires the firmware and either me-tv or kaffeine to watch TV on their PC.
(VLC can be used as well but I personally don't recommend it!.
Other options are Myth-TV or Kodi (formerly XBMC).)

You will need to install "dvb-apps" and “kaffeine” and/or “me-tv”, also "linux-firmware-nonfree" for
the hardware "Firmware" package (drivers) for your USB stick/TV card
which may be needed for your hardware but test the stick first as it may already
be supported by the kernel and it may not even be necessary!.

Installing the package “me-tv” will automatically install “dvb-apps” but will not install “linux-firmware-nonfree”,
kaffeine will not install either package, you can install the main packages with the following terminal (Ctrl + Alt + t) command:


1. How to install and kaffeine in Linux?


a.

sudo apt-get install kaffeine

If you install “kaffeine”, please bear in mind that it will install extra KDE packages
that you most likely won't need but they are essential for the app to work!.
You can also use kaffeine for satellite and cable reception!.

If your DVB-T stick is not working because your firmware is not part of
the package “linux-firmware-nonfree”, you may have to extract and copy
the firmware file (not the folder but its contents, the file you need
will say something like: win.xp.inf) from your Windows USB device driver disk
into “File System > lib > firmware” as root, you can simply copy & paste the file,
to do this, open a terminal (Ctrl + Alt + t) or press “Alt + F2” and
type the following command:


b.

gksudo caja

(gksudo nautilus in Ubuntu)

Once you have copied the file, close your home folder and restart your PC without the DVB-T device being inserted,
if you have an internal DVB-T card, then obviously; this doesn't matter, please also note that this is only for
digital TV reception and not analogue TV!.

Once your PC has booted you can insert your USB stick; then open a terminal and type "lsusb" to see if your stick
is shown, if it is; then you are good to go and just need to scan for channels using me-tv or kaffeine.
(This is assuming you have DVB-T reception in your area!).

If it states (after typing lsusb) that the device is in a "cold state"; then you may well have to look for other
firmware elsewhere because your device is not loaded correctly or not being recognized!!.

To test and see if the receiver has been successfully loaded, open a terminal and type:


c.

dmesg | grep DVB

and you will (should) get a readout like the following:

since@compaq:~$ dmesg | grep DVB 
[ 1781.646318] DVB: registering new adapter (Hauppauge WinTV MiniStick)
[ 1781.647160] usb 2-6: DVB: registering adapter 0 frontend 0 (Siano Mobile Digital MDTV Receiver)...
[ 1781.657609] smsdvb:smsdvb_hotplug: DVB interface registered.
since@compaq:~$

If the firmware fails to load, check the system log with:

tail -f /var/log/messages

and check what has been reported, you might get something like the following if you are unlucky:

Jun 9 18:41:05 localhost kernel: [4294818.024000] tda1004x: found firmware revision 0 -- invalid
Jun 9 18:41:05 localhost kernel: [4294818.026000] tda1004x: waiting for firmware upload...
Jun 9 18:41:05 localhost kernel: [4294818.069000] tda1004x: firmware upload failed

In the example above, the firmware wasn't loaded by the kernel but this is urgently needed for the DVB device to work!.


d.

If you have an internal TV card, then run:

lspci

And you should end up with something (from a long list of other hardware) like this:

Multimedia controller: Philips Semiconductors SAA7146 (rev 01)

To show ALL hardware on your PC:

sudo lshw


2. How to install and setup Me-TV in Linux?


a.

To install linux-firmware-nonfree, use the following command:

sudo apt-get install linux-firmware-nonfree

or

sudo add-apt-repository 'deb http://cz.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu wily main multiverse'
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install linux-firmware-nonfree

b.

sudo apt-get install me-tv


c.

Make sure your Reciever-Device is connected (USB Stick, TV Card)


d.

Autoscan after channels and save them


e.

Done. Now you can look Digital Television on your Computer!


3.


a.

Do you have the driver disk for your TV stick?.

If you do, insert the disk into the CD drive and search the disk for the drivers folder, you may get lucky and find only one .inf in it?, in the example below, I have 2 but I would most likely need the one on the right!:


b.

Also, have you tried using the "Additional Drivers Tool" in the Control Centre? (with the device inserted/plugged in!). 


c.

Look for your hardware manufacturer here:

A word of caution for the above link, I recommend you don't use the dev PPA for me-tv as
the current installed Ubuntu version 1.3.7-1 is well tried and tested!.
(Personal preference, use it if you want to!)
