With the New Year fast approaching I thought now would be a great time to post the first draft of some recommended Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) gathering tools and resources. I will look to maintain this list overtime and have it grow, so if you come across something you think should be on the list, drop me an email or leave a comment for consideration.

The reconnaissance phase of any engagement is very important and can often save you alot of time and of course money. If you are really lucky you may even find the information you are looking for freely available posted online. Either way the information you find will only be as good as the tools you use, so with this in mind here is the list based on tools I have come across over the years or have been recommended by other InfoSec peeps.

* Please note even though the aim is to provide information for free OSINT Tools, some may require a subscription or commercial fee.

Its not listed above, but of course popular Social Networks such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and alike have a wealth of information. Of course also consider older sources that are now less popular, its amazing what people leave behind on stuff like MySpace. Also remember that search engines show you stuff thats popular, not perhaps the obscure stuff you are searching for, so get creative with your search queries and use the various tools at your disposal.

Lastly I will add alot of Social Engineers dont have alot of global exposure, so do your homework of where you are targeting. If you are targeting Japan for example their number 1 Social Network is not Facebook, so you need to do recon in the right places, and put in the extra legwork to gain the relevant access.
